    <strong>The water cycle involves the exchange</strong> of energy,<i>which</i> leads to <emp>temperature</emp>.
    changes. <h2>When water evaporates</h2>, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it
    condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment.
    These heat exchanges influence climate.<p>The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes
        <em>the land with freshwater</em>. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It is also
        involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth, through processes including erosion and
        sedimentation. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet.
